											<p>A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them.</p>

										<h2>Get in touch</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Every day we meet new potential friends, and every now and then, we bump into family members that we don’t get to see too often. Or sometimes, close friends of ours will not be around as much as they used to for a variety of reasons. No matter what the reason may be, giving a friend or a family member a “keep in touch” message or card is one of the best ways to tell that person that you don’t want them out of your life, even though you may not be seeing them in person as much as you would like.</p>
